# Algorithms Repository

This repository includes three classic CS exercises. These exercises were completed during the Algorithms and Data Structures ECE course.

## 1. Maximum Subarray Problem

In this exercise, the object was to create solutions for the maximum subarry problem with different complexities, starting from a brute force algorithm and ending in a linear solution.

## 2. Airport Graph Problem

In this exercise, the object was to create a graph depicting a dense airport network and answer the following questions:
<ol type="A">
  <li>Find if every aiport is accessible to every other airport in two or less hops.</li>
  <li>Find round trips subject to some restrictions. These restrictions are presented inside the source code file.</li>
  <li>Find the shortest and the longest round trips for every different number of hops.</li>
</ol>

## 3. Credit Card Payments Hashing Problem

In this exercise, the object was to create 1 million card payments, insert them into a hash table and answer the following questions:
<ol type="A">
  <li>Find the card with the largest sum of money spent.</li>
  <li>Find the card with the most payments.</li>
  <li>Find the day with the most visits.</li>
  <li>Find the collisions in the final table for three different load factors.</li>
</ol>
